### Opiniated building blocks for modern web-apps

This library contains components, both primitive and complex, that are often used in modern web-apps.  
The components are for [React](https://reactjs.org/) built using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) and [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/).

## Installation

Installing the components is easily done through yarn (or npm if you so prefer):

```
$ yarn add stinodes-ui
```

```
$ npm install --save stinodes-ui
```

These rely on several peer-dependencies, which you are to install yourself:

- `react`
- `react-dom`
- `@emotion/react`
- `@emotion/styled`
- `emotion-theming`

Installing everything in one go:

```
$ yarn add stinodes-ui react react-dom @emotion/react @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

```
$ npm install --save stinodes-ui react react-dom @emotion/react @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

## Usage

All components are named exports.
Documentation and Storybook-powered demo incoming.
